  "course_name": "Building a Serverless App Platform on Kubernetes - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "​​Businesses are modernizing and adopting multi-cloud approaches to deliver services. This shift in application deployment has given rise to containerization and Kubernetes for the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. \n\nThis course introduces you to serverless computing and shows you how to build serverless applications using Knative. It teaches CI/CD using Tekton and shows you how to build pipelines triggered by GitHub events. You will create a pipeline that builds container images using Build and, later, Cloud Native Buildpacks. \n\nIn the last part of the course, you will build a web application that integrates with GitHub using a GitHub App, and triggers application build and deployment in response to GitHub events.",
